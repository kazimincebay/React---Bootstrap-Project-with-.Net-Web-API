# React---Bootstrap-Project-with-.Net-Web-API

Hello Everyone! I completed the ASP.NET Web API React - Bootstrap Project, Part of the Education of ReactJS: Uygulamalı React JS Eğitimi, on Udemy, prepared by Can Boz. You can create departments and employees, and edit or delete them within this project. Firstly, ı developed the API part with .NET Web API, then ı developed a React project. I used Fetch in a React project. 

Note: I had a problem with GitHub commits and ı couldn't fix this a few days ago, but yesterday ı could fix that problem, so thanks to Egemen Sevgi (github.com/egemendokkodo) for helping me
